Hereâ€™s a simplified `README.md` file for your Fake News Detection project:

# **Fake News Detection**

## **Overview**
This project classifies news articles as either **True** or **Fake** using machine learning. It preprocesses the text data, extracts features, and trains a model to make predictions.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: For data processing and model training.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation.
  - `nltk` for text preprocessing.
  - `scikit-learn` for feature extraction and machine learning.
  - `matplotlib` and `wordcloud` for data visualization.

---

## **Steps to Run the Project**

### 1. **Install Required Libraries**
Make sure Python is installed. Then, install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy nltk scikit-learn matplotlib wordcloud
```

### 2. **Prepare the Data**
- Place the datasets (`true.csv` and `fake.csv`) in the project folder.
- The `true.csv` file should contain real news articles, and `fake.csv` should contain fake ones.

### 3. **Run the Code**
Run the main script to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance:
```bash
python main.py
```

## **How It Works**
1. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Clean the text by removing special characters, URLs, and numbers.
   - Convert text to lowercase and remove stopwords.
   - Lemmatize words to their base form.

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Convert text into numerical form using TF-IDF vectorization.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Train a Logistic Regression model to classify the news.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model's accuracy and display a classification report.

---

## **Future Improvements**
- Use advanced models like LSTMs or BERT for better accuracy.
- Add a web interface to classify news articles in real time.
